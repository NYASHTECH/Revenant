# Revenant
 
Considered as a reliable method for remotely accessing systems via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for both joined and non-joined domain computers. Used to execute command and payloads into other computers.
- Establish an SMB connection into the chosen Driver Share.
- Copy the desired payload and pushing it in to share. ( any Writeable share driver )
- Using Lateral movement technique to execute a payload by tasking scheduling (OLE Objects)

In general, this tool will allow both users and administrators to push malicious payloads into compromised shares while using the Task Scheduling interface (OLE) to execute uploaded binaries or scripts,the tool commonly used to move east-west (Lateral Movement ) between joined domain computers.
